(Wallpaper for hyprlock and rofi change automatically with the `wals-change.sh` and others using sed not pywal)

I cannot make rofi themes but I took a lot of inspiration from [this repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi) and a lot of other repos I found from unix porn and stuff

Plans:
1. Pywal the waybar and other color schema
2. Fix swaync and config it properly
3. If god permits switch to ags
